* is the score changing monotonically? NO => âˆ´we can't bs.

* monocarp always play in cycle (A_0, A_1, ..., A_n, A_0, ...)
  and A is sorted in increasing order.

* the ans is some no. of cycles + some prefix of A.

* can we find this no. of cycles somehow?

* at first you win some k <= n match and lose n - k ones adding to
  your score 2k + n.

* if 2k + n <= 0 then we can't reach y otherwise we can
  - because the added value will not ever decrease it either
    stays the same or increases.

         (for now we only know if the ans is -1 or not)

* now if monocarp wins k at the starting x.
  we can calculate how much he needs to win k + 1, k + 2, . . ., n.
  we have not forget to calculate if he already reached y before he
  is able to win versus all n opponent.
